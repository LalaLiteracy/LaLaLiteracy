## About LaLa Literacy

LaLa Literacy is an alpha-stage, open-source platform for music literacy, grounded in Hattieâ€™s (2023) Visible Learning model and Brunerâ€™s recursive learning models (1960, 1966, 1996). Built by music educators and friends, for music literacy development, it provides structure, curriculum tools, and community resources to co-create the future of music education. Designed by Kari Sabatella, a music teacher since 1994 who wanted to help students develop independence in reading and writing music. By carefully planning focused lessons with a longitudinal approach, LaLa Literacy gives teachers the tools and structure to build student agency and independence in notational music literacy outcomes. LaLa Literacy reduces teacher burnout and increases student achievement in music while maintaining creative control and time for performances.
